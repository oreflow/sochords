# SoChords

NOTE: SoChords is currently a work in progress, but current version is available at https://sochords.com

SoChords aims to allow users to manage and present guitar chords and tabs in a simple way. It was built due to most other applications with similar purpose not scaling well due to using raw text to format this.


## Understanding Chords

SoChords was also built to learn "building chords" and musical theory, rules for how many chords are constructed available in the chordgenerator directory. Which is used to power https://sochords.com/chordExplorer.
